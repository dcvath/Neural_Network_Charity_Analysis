# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to help Alphabet Soupâ€™s foundation predict where to make investments. We used machine learning and neural networks to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. For this analysis, we were provided a CSV containing over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Included within that dataset were a number of columns that captured metadata about each organization.


## Results
Below, please find the results of the analysis:

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?



- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?


- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?



### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Mode 
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?



- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?



- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?



## Summary
Based on the analysis, 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
